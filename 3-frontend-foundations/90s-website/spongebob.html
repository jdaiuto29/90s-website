        SpongeBob SquarePants (also simply referred to as SpongeBob) is an American animated comedy television series created by marine 
        science educator and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series chronicles the adventures of the title character and 
        his aquatic friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Being the fifth-longest-running American animated series, its 
        high popularity has made it a media franchise. It is the highest rated series to air on Nickelodeon as well as the most profitable 
        property for ViacomCBS Consumer Products, having generated over $13 billion in merchandising revenue as of 2019. Many of the series' 
        ideas originated in The Intertidal Zone, an unpublished educational book that Hillenburg created in 1989 to teach his students about 
        undersea life. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996, and in 1997, a seven-minute pilot was 
        pitched to Nickelodeon. The network's executives wanted SpongeBob to be a child in school, but Hillenburg preferred SpongeBob to be 
        an adult character. He was prepared to "walk out" on Nickelodeon and abandon the series, but he compromised by creating Mrs. Puff and 
        her boating school, so that SpongeBob could attend school as an adult.

        Nickelodeon held a preview for the series in the United States 
        on May 1, 1999, after it aired the 1999 Kids' Choice Awards. The series officially premiered on July 17, 1999. It has received worldwide 
        critical acclaim since its premiere and had gained enormous popularity by its second season. The thirteenth season began airing in October 2020.
        The series has inspired three feature films: The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004), Sponge Out of Water (2015), and Sponge on the Run (2020). 
        Two spin-off series, Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years and The Patrick Star Show, premiered in 2021. An additional spin-off, an untitled project 
        based on the character Squidward Tentacles, is in development as of 2020. An additional spin-off style movie was announced for the character 
        Sandy Cheeks in May 2021. SpongeBob SquarePants has won a variety of awards including six Annie Awards, eight Golden Reel Awards, 
        four Emmy Awards, 18 Kids' Choice Awards, and two BAFTA Children's Awards. A Broadway musical based on the series opened in 2017 to 
        critical acclaim.
