        The Ren & Stimpy Show (also known simply as Ren & Stimpy) is an American animated television series created by Canadian animator John Kricfalusi 
        and originally produced by Spümcø for Nickelodeon that aired from August 11, 1991 to October 20, 1996. The series follows the adventures of the title 
        characters: Ren Höek, an emotionally unstable and sociopathic Chihuahua; and Stimpy, a good-natured yet dimwitted cat. The Ren & Stimpy Show was one of 
        Nickelodeon's first original animated series—known as "Nicktoons"—alongside Rugrats and Doug. In contrast with other shows on the network and throughout its 
        run to present day, the series is deemed controversial for its dark humor, sexual innuendos, adult humor, violence and shock value. This controversy contributed 
        to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. The series ended its original run on Nickelodeon on December 16, 1995, 
        with a total of five seasons and 51 episodes. In addition, Spümcø's failure to deliver episodes on time and their deteriorating relationship with the network led to 
        Kricfalusi's termination from the show in 1992, with Games Animation producing the remainder of the series.

        One episode was initially left unaired until it was 
        broadcast on MTV on October 20, 1996. Nonetheless, The Ren & Stimpy Show received very positive reviews during its original run and quickly developed a cult 
        following. It is considered by many to have had a long-lasting influence on television animation. As of 2021, 37 episodes are available to watch on Paramount+. A 
        reboot series for adult audiences, Ren & Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon", was produced by Kricfalusi and Spümcø and aired in 2003 on Spike TV. Receiving negative 
        reviews from critics and fans, with many considering it to be one of the worst animated television shows of all time, the series aired only three episodes before 
        it was canceled, with three additional episodes being released straight to DVD. On August 5, 2020, Comedy Central announced that they had ordered a second revival 
        of the series to be produced without the involvement of Kricfalusi.
