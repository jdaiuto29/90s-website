        Are You Afraid of the Dark? is a horror anthology television series that was produced by YTV and distributed by Nickelodeon. The original series aired from 1990 
        to 1996. It led to two revival series, with the first airing from 1999 to 2000, and the second debuting in 2019. The original series was distributed worldwide 
        by D. J. MacHale and Ned Kandel and was picked up by Nickelodeon in 1991 and produced by YTV. MacHale, Kandel, and Nickelodeon teamed up with the Canadian 
        company Cinar, and as a part of the deal the show was filmed in Richmond, British Columbia, and in the Greater Montreal area of Quebec. The production teams 
        were respectively represented by the ACTRA and SCTVQ (Syndicat des techniciens du cinéma et de la vidéo du Québec) labour unions. The series premiered with 
        the episode "The Tale of the Twisted Claw" as a pilot on October 31, 1990, on the Canadian television network YTV and aired until June 11, 2000. The pilot aired 
        on Nickelodeon on October 25, 1991, as part of a Halloween special. The following year, the series premiered on Nickelodeon's SNICK on August 15, 1992, and aired 
        until April 20, 1996.

        The show was both a critical and commercial success, garnering numerous awards as the series progressed. The first revival series, with 
        new directors, writers, and a cast, was produced by Nickelodeon from 1999 to 2000 and also aired on the SNICK block. The sole member from the original lineup 
        to return for the first and second seasons of the revival was Tucker (Daniel DeSanto), although Gary (Ross Hull) returned for the concluding show, which notably 
        broke from the show's established format by blurring the line between story and "reality". On November 13, 2017, it was announced that Paramount Players would 
        make a live-action feature film adaptation. However, the film was later removed from Paramount's schedule. On February 14, 2019, it was announced that the series 
        would be revived again for a limited series, which premiered on October 11, 2019. On February 19, 2020, this revival was renewed for a second season, titled 
        Are You Afraid of the Dark?: Curse of the Shadows, featuring a different cast. The second season premiered on February 12, 2021.
