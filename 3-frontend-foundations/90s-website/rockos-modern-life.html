        Rocko's Modern Life is an American animated television series created by Joe Murray for Nickelodeon. The series centers on the surreal life of an 
        anthropomorphic Australian immigrant wallaby named Rocko and his friends: the eccentric steer Heffer Wolfe, the neurotic turtle Filburt, and Rocko's 
        faithful dog Spunky. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run to present day, this show is controversial for its adult humor, including 
        double entendre, innuendo, and satirical social commentary, similar to The Ren & Stimpy Show. The series has gained a cult following. Murray created the title 
        character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, which was looking for edgier 
        cartoonists for its then-new Nicktoons. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. 
        The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A special, entitled Rocko's Modern 
        Life: Static Cling, was digitally released on Netflix on August 9, 2019. The show launched the careers of voice actors Carlos Alazraqui and Tom Kenny. 
        After the show's cancellation, much of the staff regrouped to work on SpongeBob SquarePants, created by Rocko's creative director Stephen Hillenburg.
