<p>
The <a href="https://www.giants.com/">New York Giants</a> are a professional American football team based in the New York metropolitan area. The Giants compete in the National Football League (NFL) as 
a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium (shared with the New York Jets) in 
East Rutherford, New Jersey, 5 miles (8 km) west of New York City. The Giants hold their summer training camp at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center at the Meadowlands
Sports Complex.
</p>

<p>
The Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925, and are the only one of that group still existing, as well as the league's longest-established team 
in the Northeastern United States. The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL championship titles: four in the <strong>preâ€“Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956)</strong>
and four since the advent of the <strong>Super Bowl (XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011))</strong>, along with more championship appearances than any other team, with 19 overall appearances.
Their championship tally is surpassed only by the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9).
</p> 

<p>
Throughout their history, the Giants have featured 29 Hall of Fame players, including NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winners Mel Hein, Frank Gifford, Y. A. Tittle,
and Lawrence Taylor. To distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name, the football team was incorporated as the "New York National League 
Football Company, Inc." in 1929 and changed to "New York Football Giants, Inc." in 1937. While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, the 
football team continues to use "New York Football Giants, Inc." as its legal corporate name, and is often referred to by fans and sportscasters as the "New York Football Giants".
The team has also acquired several nicknames, including <strong>"Big Blue"</strong>, the <strong>"G-Men"</strong>, and the <strong>"Jints"</strong>, an intentionally mangled contraction 
seen frequently in the New York Post and New York Daily News, originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York. In addition, the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the "Big Blue Wrecking Crew", even though this moniker primarily
and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 1980s and early-1990s.
</p>

<p>
The team's heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933, and has been called the best rivalry 
in the NFL in the 21st century.
