            <br>
            <br>
                <p>This exercise is about making lists</p>
                <p>This is what I like about making lists:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
                    <li>That's about it</li>
                    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
                    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul, otherwise use the ol tag
                        <ul><li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other!</li>
                            </ol>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
